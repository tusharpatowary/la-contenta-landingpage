# Restaurant Website
Welcome to the Demo website of La Contenta! 
## About This Website
This website is a product of my practice in HTML and CSS web design. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my skills in creating layouts and crafting visually appealing web pages. While the main purpose was learning and practice, I've made efforts to make the site enjoyable to navigate as you explore our restaurant and its offerings.
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** The foundation of the website is built using HTML5, allowing for structured content and layout.

- **CSS3:** To style and design the website, I utilized CSS3. This includes various visual elements, color schemes, and layout choices.

## Source Code and Learning

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use it as a reference for your own projects. Keep in mind that this project served as a practice exercise to refine my HTML and CSS skills.

If you're also learning web development, I encourage you to practice, experiment, and continuously improve your skills. It's through projects like these that we grow and become better developers.
